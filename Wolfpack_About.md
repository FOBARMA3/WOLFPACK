### Storyline
June 2034, Altis is in turmoil. The island has been cut off from the outside world due to economical and physical blockades. The local populous has grown impatient with the government and the AFF in particular. Several demonstrations have resulted in the deaths of tens of civilians.

The government was losing control rapidly and called in the help of CSAT. A mistake that would cost them dearly. CSAT saw a golden opportunity to get a much needed foothold in the Mediterranean area. The AAF requested a single battalion of CSAT Infantry. Instead CSAT send the entire 2nd brigade and soon CSAT outnumbers AAF by 11:1. Altis government realized that they lost control completely and stepped down. CSAT General Tehrani has since been in power and controls all of Altis and Stratis.

CSAT is now proven a serious threat to the European region. As diplomatic efforts have not lead to the anticipated result, NATO decided to send a rapid task force to free both islands from CSAT oppression. DEVGRU has been ordered by J.S.O.C. to take out several high value threads on Altis before the NATO campaign commences. Wolf has been tasked with executing 10 missions over a period of 3-4 weeks. Your first mission commences 11 June.
