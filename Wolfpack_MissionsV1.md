# Missions Volume 1

## DAY 01 - THE PACKAGE
Our area of operation lies north of Athira. JSOC expects a HVT to arrive and inspect the CSAR Frini base tomorrow.  Wolf will eliminate the HVT once he arrives at the base. Due to the sensitive nature of this mission, detailed objectives will be given on a need to know basis once you have reached the RV. Our local on the ground will do an extensive briefing.

## DAY 02 - KAJMAN FIRE
CSAT has taken over the Abdera Airfield and turned the airfield into a helicopter base. The base is home to the 127 AAC Squadron with 6 or 8 Kajman Attack helicopters and to the 17 Air Support Group. About one kilometer north east lies the village of Krya Nera. This used to be a little fisherman's village until CSAT stationed a small fleet of attack vessels there. Primary objective: Abdera Airfield, sabotage all Kajman Attack helicopters stationed at the airfield. Secondary objective: Krya Nera Naval Base, take control of the Naval Base and wait for further instructions.

## DAY 03 - SWITCH OFF
CSAT's primary communications station is situated on the outskirts of Kavala. It is essential we disrupt communications before we commence the NATO invasion. The nearby power station provides power to the Kavala region, including the communications station. We need to take both out in order to be sure that CSAT's ability to communicate is disrupted. Primary objective: Sabotage the communications station.  Secondary objective: Sabotage the power station. 

## DAY 04 - TOP SCREEN
CSAT's propaganda campaign is out of control. Their fear and retribution series broadcasted on television and radio has caused grave concerns both locally and abroad. We need the local populous on our side once the invasions commences. We need to shut down the Altis Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the Capital of Altis, Pyrgos.Sabotage the ABC headquarters. You'll be filled in on the specifics once you are close to the objective.

## DAY 05 - BULLSEYE
Maj. F. Kallaziz's replacement has arrived in Pyrgos, Maj. Farrokhzad. We know very little about Maj. Farrokhzad. According to Nikko, the major has already made his mark by having tens of civilians arrested. Supposedly there is a public hanging the day after tomorrow. CIA and MIS are working hard to get more intel about this guy. So it looks like your Wolf troops are going back to Pyrgos. Your objective is to find intel on Maj. Farrokhzad.
